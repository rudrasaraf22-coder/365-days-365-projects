## 🚀 How to Run

1.  Ensure all files are in the **same folder**.
2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3.  Start typing your tasks!

## 🛠️ How it Works

- **HTML**: Provides the input field and an empty `<ul>` list.
- **JavaScript**:
    - Listens for the click on the "Add" button or the "Enter" key.
    - Uses `document.createElement` to dynamically build new list items (`<li>`) when you add a task.
    - Attaches a specific `click` event to every new delete button to remove its parent element.
