### Tips for your GitHub/Netlify:
1.  **Screenshots:** If you upload this to GitHub, it's nice to add a screenshot of the dark interface inside the `README.md` using the syntax `![Screenshot](image.png)`.
2.  **Social Preview:** Netlify usually generates a preview image automatically, but you can add a `screenshot.png` in your root folder to customize what people see when they share your link `https://mordernstopwatchrs.netlify.app/`.
